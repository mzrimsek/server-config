# Dashboard

Set up a nice dashboard with [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) to access hosted services and frequently accessed sites all in a convenient, centralized location.

- Customization:
  - Must have a directory to persist assets, mounted as a volume to `/www/assets`
  - For ease of use, mount your `config.yml` to `/www/assets/config.yml`

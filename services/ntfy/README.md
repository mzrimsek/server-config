# ntfy

[ntfy](https://docs.ntfy.sh/) is super simple and robust notification service.

## Notes

Initial setup

1. Deploy docker compose stack
2. Create cache.db file in cache directory
3. Create auth.db file in cache directory
4. chown the config directory to your user

When configuring I enabled sign up, added my user, and then disabled sign up. I then edited the db file to make my user an admin.

# Muse

[Muse](https://github.com/codetheweb/muse) is a music bot for small to medium Discord servers. It became a necessity in the wake of Rhythm bot being murdered by Google in mid 2021. Not only does it work well but it's super easy to set up - there are several tokens that are required that the repository walks you through setting up.

- Data: Must have a directory to mount as a volume to the container at `/data`

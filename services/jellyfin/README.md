# Jellyfin

[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) is an open source Plex alternative that allows you to organize and view various media types.

At one point, for my setup in particular I mounted volumes from my NAS to leverage the central data store I have setup. I have since migrated the container to the NAS for direct file access but have left a docker-compose configuration as reference regardless.

# ldap

An LDAP server is great for centralizing login credentials, especially as the number of services being maintained grows (seemingly) exponentially.

## Notes

After you start the stack, make sure to navigate to "`LDAP_UI_URL`/setup" and enter `LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, then follow the steps to setup your LDAP server. After this initial setup, the admin user that was created during setup will no longer be used and you will log in with your user you created during setup.

# Mere Medical

Mere Medical is a service that provides a simple API for managing medical records.

Because of how it it designed to sync data from other services, it is not recommended to deploy this service without HTTPS enabled. As such I am only providing a docker-compose file for deploying this service with Traefik configured on it.

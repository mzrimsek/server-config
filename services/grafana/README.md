# Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a powerful, open source data visualization tool.

This works well with the [system monitoring stack](../../stacks/system-monitoring/). Some basic dashboards for this stack is provided in the `dashboard-templates` folder. Create a new dashboard, edit it, open the JSON view, and paste in the template to apply it.
